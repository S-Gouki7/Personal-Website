        <p>
            This game is pretty fun and fast-paced, the good thing is that both casual and competetive players can enjoy it for its mechanics. furthermore, its good DLC. Broly, Vegeto, Zamasu, and Bardock or great additions to this game.
            Its even better if you play it on pc, due to the insane modes created on the platform.
